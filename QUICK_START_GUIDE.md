# Quick Start Guide: Drone Implementation

## TL;DR - Can I Use This for a Drone?

**YES** âœ… - But with significant modifications required.

### What You'll Need
- **Budget**: $340-500
- **Time**: 12-16 weeks (part-time)
- **Skills**: Python, basic computer vision, drone experience
- **Key Hardware**: Raspberry Pi 4/5 + Intel RealSense depth camera

## Step-by-Step Quick Start

### Week 1: Get Hardware
```
Order:
âœ“ Raspberry Pi 4B 8GB ($75) or Pi 5 8GB ($80)
âœ“ Intel RealSense D435i ($200)
âœ“ 64GB+ microSD card ($15)
âœ“ Cooling solution ($10-15)
âœ“ Power supply/BEC ($10)
Total: ~$310-340
```

### Week 2-3: Setup Software
```bash
# 1. Flash Raspberry Pi OS (64-bit)
# 2. Update system
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y

# 3. Install dependencies
sudo apt install python3-pip python3-opencv
pip3 install numpy opencv-python pyrealsense2

# 4. Clone this repo
git clone https://github.com/AralCA/MotionExtraction.git
cd MotionExtraction
pip3 install -r requirements.txt

# 5. Test with sample video
python3 main.py video.mp4
```

### Week 3-4: Camera Integration
```bash
# Test RealSense camera
python3 -c "import pyrealsense2 as rs; print('RealSense OK')"

# Modify code for camera input (see main report Section 6.3)
```

### Week 4-8: Obstacle Detection
```bash
# Implement obstacle_detector.py (see code in main report)
# Test with stationary objects
# Tune detection parameters
```

### Week 8-12: Integration & Testing
```bash
# Connect to drone
# Ground testing
# Tethered flight tests
# Progressive flight testing
```

## Critical Configuration Changes

Edit `config.py` for drone operation:

```python
class Config:
    # Real-time optimizations
    GRID_ROWS = 3              # Reduced from 5
    GRID_COLS = 3              # Reduced from 5
    SEARCH_STEP_SIZE = 2       # Increased from 1
    MAX_RECURSIVE_DEPTH = 0    # Disabled for speed
    FRAME_SKIP = 2             # Process every 2nd frame
    
    # Disable heavy visualizations
    SHOW_MOTION_VECTORS = False
    SHOW_COMPASS = False
    SHOW_GRID_LINES = False
```

## Key Challenges & Solutions

| Challenge | Solution |
|-----------|----------|
| Too slow | Reduce resolution, optimize config, add Coral TPU |
| Vibrations | Better dampening, faster shutter, use IMU |
| Power consumption | Larger battery, optimize code, reduce FPS |
| Detection range | Use depth camera (RealSense), not just vision |
| 3D mapping | Use RTAB-Map with RealSense for RGB-D SLAM |

## Safety Checklist

Before any flight:
- [ ] Manual override tested and working
- [ ] Return-to-home configured
- [ ] Battery monitoring active
- [ ] Geofencing enabled
- [ ] Emergency stop accessible
- [ ] Backup pilot ready
- [ ] Safety tether (for first flights)

---

## When to Stop and Reconsider

ðŸ›‘ Stop if:
- Cannot achieve >10 FPS processing
- False obstacle detections >20%
- System overheats during operation
- Power consumption reduces flight time >40%
- Unable to maintain stable video feed

## Alternative: Quick Win Approach

Instead of full integration, try this simpler approach:

1. **Use ArduPilot's built-in obstacle avoidance**
   - Already supports RealSense cameras
   - Tested and reliable
   - Less development needed

2. **Use this project for post-flight analysis**
   - Record video during flight
   - Analyze motion and create maps later
   - No real-time constraints

3. **Hybrid approach**
   - Simple obstacle detection on drone
   - Complex 3D mapping on ground station
   - Stream video via WiFi/4G

## Expected Results

### Obstacle Detection
- **Range**: 0.5-5 meters
- **Update Rate**: 10-15 Hz
- **Latency**: 50-100ms
- **Accuracy**: 90%+ with depth camera

### 3D Mapping
- **Resolution**: 1-5cm point spacing
- **Coverage**: 50-100mÂ² per flight
- **Accuracy**: 5-10cm RMS error
- **Data Size**: 100MB-1GB per flight

### Flight Impact
- **Weight Added**: 150-200g
- **Power Draw**: 8-12W
- **Flight Time Loss**: 15-25%
- **Max Speed**: Reduced by 20-30%
