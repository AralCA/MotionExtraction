**Steps**:
1. Connect via serial/USB (telemetry port)
2. Use pymavlink library in Python
3. Read vehicle state (position, attitude)
4. Send avoidance commands (velocity/position override)
5. Monitor safety status

**Compatible autopilots**:
- ‚úÖ ArduPilot (ArduCopter, ArduPlane)
- ‚úÖ PX4
- ‚ö†Ô∏è iNav (limited support)
- ‚ùå Betaflight (racing FCs, no MAVLink)

See Section 6, Phase 6 of [Feasibility Report](DRONE_FEASIBILITY_REPORT.md).

---

### Q18: What if it's too slow on Raspberry Pi?
**A**: Several optimization options:

**Software optimizations**:
1. Reduce resolution further (320x240)
2. Process fewer frames (every 3rd)
3. Simplify algorithm (use optical flow instead of template matching)
4. Disable all visualization
5. Use compiled libraries (C++ instead of Python)

**Hardware upgrades**:
1. Add Coral USB Accelerator ($60) - 5-10x speedup for neural networks
2. Use Raspberry Pi 5 instead of 4
3. Upgrade to Jetson Nano ($150-200) - Much more powerful GPU

**Alternative approach**:
- Offload processing to ground station
- Send video via WiFi/4G
- Process on PC, send commands back
- Limitation: Latency and range

---

### Q19: How do I handle different lighting conditions?
**A**: Challenges and solutions:

**Bright sunlight**:
- Issue: IR depth cameras struggle
- Solution: Use stereo vision or increase IR power
- Workaround: Fly in morning/evening, avoid noon

**Low light**:
- Issue: Camera can't see clearly
- Solution: Use IR-capable camera or add lighting
- Workaround: Limit flight to daytime

**Mixed light** (shadows):
- Issue: Exposure varies across frame
- Solution: HDR imaging, local histogram equalization
- Workaround: Avoid high-contrast scenes

**Best practice**: Test in target conditions before relying on system.

### Q21: What safety features should I implement?
**A**: Essential safety features:

**Hardware failsafes**:
- ‚úÖ Manual override (RC always active)
- ‚úÖ Return-to-home on connection loss
- ‚úÖ Geofencing (don't fly outside boundary)
- ‚úÖ Battery monitoring and alerts
- ‚úÖ Watchdog timer (reset if system hangs)

**Software failsafes**:
- ‚úÖ Sanity checks on sensor data
- ‚úÖ Timeout detection (stale data)
- ‚úÖ Graceful degradation (fallback modes)
- ‚úÖ Data logging for post-flight analysis
- ‚úÖ Pre-flight checks

**Testing requirements**:

- ‚úÖ Progressive complexity increase
- ‚úÖ Emergency procedure practice
- ‚úÖ Multiple test pilots

---

### Q22: What happens if the system fails during flight?
**A**: Depends on failure mode and setup:

**If Raspberry Pi crashes**:
- Flight controller continues flying (if properly integrated)
- Return-to-home activates (if configured)
- Manual control always available

**If sensor fails**:
- System should detect and alert
- Switch to manual/degraded mode
- Return to safe location

**If communication lost**:
- Drone executes failsafe (RTH or land)
- Local data still logged
- Pilot takes manual control

**Key principle**: System should fail to safe state, never fail to dangerous state.

### Q27: The camera can't detect obstacles reliably. Why?
**A**: Several possible causes:

**Check these**:
1. **Depth camera range**: Are obstacles within 0.5-5m?
2. **Lighting**: Is it too bright (outdoor) or too dark?
3. **Surface type**: Are obstacles IR-reflective? (glass, mirrors fail)
4. **Motion speed**: Flying too fast for reaction time?
5. **Vibration**: Is camera image stable?
6. **Calibration**: Is camera properly calibrated?
7. **Thresholds**: Are detection thresholds too strict?

**Debugging**:
- Save depth images and review them
- Check FPS - if too slow, late detections
- Test stationary with known obstacles
- Verify RealSense SDK examples work

---

### Q28: My 3D map is distorted or drifting. What's wrong?
**A**: Common SLAM issues:

**Causes of drift**:
- Lack of visual features (blank walls)
- Too much motion blur
- Insufficient overlap between frames
- No loop closure
- Poor lighting

**Solutions**:
1. Fly slower for better frame overlap
2. Add loop closure detection
3. Improve lighting
4. Use more features (increase number tracked)
5. Fuse with GPS/IMU data
6. Reduce rolling shutter artifacts

**Validation**:
- Fly figure-8 pattern, check if loop closes
- Compare to ground truth measurements
- Review pose graph for inconsistencies
