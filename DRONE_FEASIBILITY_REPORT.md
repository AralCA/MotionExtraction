## 12. Risk Assessment

### High Risk Items ⚠️
1. **Insufficient Processing Power**: May require hardware upgrade
   - Mitigation: Test early, have Jetson Nano as backup
   
2. **Unreliable Obstacle Detection**: False positives/negatives
   - Mitigation: Extensive testing, sensor fusion, keep pilot in control

3. **Flight Time Reduction**: System too power-hungry
   - Mitigation: Optimize code, larger battery, offload processing

### Medium Risk Items ⚠️
4. **Vibration Interference**: Unstable readings
   - Mitigation: Better dampening, faster shutter speed

5. **Data Link Range**: Lose connection during mission
   - Mitigation: Autonomous mode, return-to-home, local storage

6. **Weather Sensitivity**: Wind, rain affect performance
   - Mitigation: Flight envelope limits, weather monitoring

### Low Risk Items ✅
7. **Software Bugs**: Standard development risks
   - Mitigation: Testing, code review, version control

8. **Integration Challenges**: Components don't work together
   - Mitigation: Incremental integration, interface testing

## 14. Alternative Approaches

### 14.1 Offload Processing to Ground Station
**Concept**: Stream video to powerful ground computer

**Pros**:
- Unlimited processing power
- No weight/power constraints on drone
- Easier development and debugging

**Cons**:
- Requires reliable high-bandwidth link (WiFi or 4G)
- Higher latency (50-200ms)
- Limited range (WiFi: 100-500m)

**Feasibility**: ✅ Good for testing, ⚠️ limited for production

### 14.2 Use Existing Autopilot Obstacle Avoidance
**Concept**: Leverage built-in features of ArduPilot/PX4

**Pros**:
- Already developed and tested
- Well-integrated with flight controller
- Supports multiple sensor types

**Cons**:
- May not meet specific 3D mapping needs
- Less customizable
- Still requires compatible hardware

**Feasibility**: ✅ HIGH - Recommended as starting point

### 14.3 Hybrid Processing
**Concept**: Simple obstacle detection on-board, complex mapping off-board

**Pros**:
- Best of both worlds
- Real-time safety with detailed mapping
- Lower on-board power requirements

**Cons**:
- More complex system architecture
- Requires good datalink
- Needs synchronization

**Feasibility**: ✅ HIGH - Recommended for production system
